# Lab 3: Serial Communication between devices

In this lab we make IMU interact with the PowerDue using I2C and SPI protocols. For embedded systems, serial buses are the preferred mode of communication between devices. Therefore, it is important to understand how they work and how much energy they consume. 

__objectives__

- Write drivers for interfacing sensors
- Manage I/O on an embedded system using FreeRTOS
- Examine I2C and SPI transaction
- Practice reading device datasheets
- Observe the energy consumption for communication
